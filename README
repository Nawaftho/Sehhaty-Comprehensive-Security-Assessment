Title: Comprehensive Security Assessment of Sehhaty
Course: CPIT-455
Student: Nawaf Abdullah Al-Thobaiti

Submitted to: Prof. Adeeb Noor

Project Description

This Java proof-of-concept demonstrates core cybersecurity controls for the national Sehhaty healthcare platform. It accompanies the written security assessment submitted for CPIT-455.
The code simulates authentication, access control, encryption of sensitive fields, secure logging, and safe exception handling.

This is not real production code. It exists only to illustrate required security principles in a simplified environment.

Features Demonstrated

• Login validation and password hashing
• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
• Field-level encryption of medical data
• Audit logging for data access accountability
• Input validation and secure error handling

Code Structure

SehhatySecurityDemo – Main execution and demonstration scenario

AuthService – User authentication and verification

PasswordHasher – Demonstration hashing logic

HealthRecordService – Permission checking for record access

CryptoService – Placeholder encryption for sensitive health fields

InMemory stores – Temporary data storage for users/records

AuditService – Logging of sensitive operations

GlobalExceptionHandler – Centralized exception management

How to Run

Requirements:
Java JDK 8 or later

Commands:

javac SehhatySecurityDemo.java
java SehhatySecurityDemo


Expected behavior:
• Patient login and ability to view own medical record
• Patient blocked from viewing another patient’s record
• Doctor allowed to access patient records
• Audit logs generated for every authorized record access

Security Notes and Academic Focus

The implementation is simplified for demonstration:

Base64 is used instead of strong encryption (AES-GCM)

Password hashing is not suitable for production (BCrypt/Argon2 needed)

Tokens are not signed or validated

Doctor-patient mapping rules not enforced

These decisions intentionally highlight concepts from the written security report.
